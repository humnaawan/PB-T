## Project Description

We carry out a multiclass classification problem for predicting loan status from a rich dataset, building a (mock) loan approval pre-check system for potential customers. We employ various data techniques (e.g., imputation, one-hot encoding) and test multiple ML algorithms (Random Forest, Supper Vector Machine, and k-Nearest Neighbors).

We presented our work to the cohort at the end of the School; see [here](https://github.com/humnaawan/PB-T/blob/master/final%20presentation/Loan%20Outcomes.ipynb) for the presentation.
